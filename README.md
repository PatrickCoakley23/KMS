This was an exciting project for me as it was the first professional website I developed as a free lance developer after graduating from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). 

[Keane Mahony Smith](http://www.keanemahonysmith.ie/) is an established auctioneering firm based in Cork City. Their previous website was a templated website which was very limited and lacked its own unique style. [Darragh Taaffe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darragh-taaffe-232745154/) of Keane Mahony Smith's main brief of the new website was to be unique and edgy so it stood out from the industry normal mundane real estate/ auctioneer websites.

The website was built using the [Django Framework]( https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) as it was ideal to build a centrally-owned dataset to handle all the properties listed for sale.

## **User Experience (UX)**

-   ### User Stories

    - As a Seller 

    - As a user i want to read an 'about section', so i can get a feel for the type of company and brand KMS is and what makes them different from other auctioneers. 
        - Reason for 'About' section on Homepage.

    - As a user I want to see the different services KMS offers as some auctioneers specialize in specific services eg. rental's only or property management etc
        - Reason for 'Services' section which highlights that KMS works with residential, commercial and land sales only. 
    
    - As a user I want to read some testimonials from clients who have dealt with KMS in the past.
        - Reason for 'Testimonials' section. 

    - As a user I want to see some of the properties KMS have sold in the past, in order to get a better insight into the type of houses they sell and the price they achieved for that sale. 
        - Reason for having not only the properties for sale but also the properties KMS have 'sold in the past and the properties that are 'sale agreed'. 

    - As a user i want to understand the process of a house sale. 
        - Reason for 'Selling Guide'

    
    - As a Buyer

        - As a user i want to be able to see all the properties for sale. 
            - Reason for 'Properties' page. 

        - As a user i want to be able to filter my search so i can narrow my set of properties to ones which are more specific to me. 
            - Reason for filtered search. 

        - As a user i want to be able to get a detailed insight into each property.
            - Reason for 'Property Selected' page. 

        - As a user i want to get in contact with KMS or one of their agents. 
            - Reason for 'Contact Page', 'Meet the Team' section.

        - As a user i want to see the exact location of the property so i can get a better understanding for the services in the locality. 
            - Reason for Google Maps API. 


    - As an Owner 

        - As the owner of KMS i want a website that is unique and stands out from my competitors. 
            - Reason for a colour scheme that remains constant throughout the website. Imagery is used across the website in order to interest and evoke emotion from the user. 
            - Use of slide carousel in order to add a sense of play to the testimonial and property images section.
