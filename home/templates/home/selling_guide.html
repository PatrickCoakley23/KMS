                    Once you have accepted an offer, your property will go sale agreed. We will then seek a booking deposit between 2%-5% of the purchase price and will remove the property from the market. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sale agreed is not legally binding for either party and a booking deposit is refundable until contracts are exchanged.

                    The buyer at this stage will likely seek a structural survey and a bank valuation for the bank (if they are drawing down a mortgage) which your agent will help organise.
